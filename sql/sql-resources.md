## SQL Resources

Since there are many and several resources for SQL, you can choose any course or resource that fits your learning style. The important thing is to **practice it daily** to build a strong foundation.

A good way to master SQL is to focus on solving two problems daily using the following platforms:

- [DataLemur](https://datalemur.com/questions?category=SQL)
- [Stratascratch](https://platform.stratascratch.com/coding?code_type=1)

By consistently practicing, you'll develop strong problem-solving skills and a deep understanding of SQL.
