## 📚 Core Skills & Resources (Recommended Learning Sequence)

This roadmap follows a logical progression from foundational to advanced skills. Each section contains curated resources to help you master the technology:

### 1. [Linux Resources](linux/linux-resources.md) 🐧
**Foundation Skill - Start Here**
Linux is a vital operating system in data engineering. Mastering Linux commands is essential for managing servers, files, and tasks in a data engineering environment. This is your gateway to all other technologies.

### 2. [Hadoop Resources](hadoop/hadoop-resources.md) 🐘
**Big Data Foundation**
Hadoop is a framework for distributed storage and processing of large data sets across clusters of computers. Learn Hadoop's core components (HDFS, MapReduce, YARN) and ecosystem tools.

### 3. [Docker Resources](docker/docker-resources.md) 🐳
**Containerization & Environment Management**
Docker is essential for creating isolated, reproducible environments. Learning Docker enables you to containerize applications and manage environments efficiently across different systems.

### 4. [Git & GitHub Resources](git-github/git-github-resources.md) 🔄
**Version Control & Collaboration**
Git is a version control system, and GitHub is a collaborative platform. These tools are critical for managing code, collaborating with other engineers, and maintaining project history.

### 5. [Python Resources](python/python-resources.md) 🐍
**Primary Programming Language**
Python is the go-to language for data engineers due to its simplicity and powerful libraries for data manipulation and analysis. Master Python programming and data-focused libraries like Pandas and NumPy.

### 6. [SQL Resources](sql/sql-resources.md) 🗃️
**Data Query & Manipulation**
Structured Query Language (SQL) is the backbone of data manipulation. It's a crucial skill for querying databases, building ETL pipelines, and analyzing data across various database systems.

### 7. [Database Resources](database/database-resources.md) 🛢️
**Data Storage & Management**
Understanding databases, including ACID properties, partitioning, sharding, indexing, and how data is stored, is key to becoming a competent data engineer who can design efficient data systems.

### 8. [Data Warehousing Resources](dwh/dwh-resources.md) 🏭
**Analytics & Reporting Systems**
Data warehousing is crucial for managing large datasets and enabling efficient reporting and analysis. Learn about data warehousing concepts, schemas, dimensional modeling, and ETL design patterns.

### 9. [Airflow Resources](airflow/airflow-resources.md) 🌬️
**Workflow Orchestration & Automation**
Apache Airflow is a powerful tool for automating workflows and data pipelines. Master DAG creation, scheduling, monitoring, and managing complex data pipeline dependencies.
